    question: "What is the purpose of this website?",
    answer: "This website is a prototype for a CitiBike route planner. The aim will be to recommend routes based on user preferences and goals, such as scenic routes, exercise routes, or routes with minimal traffic. The goal is to encourage more people to use CitiBike for both transportation and recreation."
  },
  {
    question: "What can I do on this website right now?",
    answer: "You can currently view all of CitiBike's docking stations in the NYC metro area. You can leave us feedback on the website and update the feedback at any time as we build this out."

  {
    question: "How does using CitiBike compare to a gym membership in terms of cost and health benefits?",
    answer: "CitiBike can be more cost-effective than a gym membership, especially if you use it frequently. While a gym offers a wider variety of exercises, CitiBike provides cardiovascular benefits and the added perk of outdoor exercise. It also integrates physical activity into your daily routine, which can be more sustainable for some people than dedicated gym time."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the environmental impacts of choosing CitiBike over owning a personal bike?",
    answer: "CitiBike can have a lower environmental impact than owning a personal bike, particularly if you don't ride frequently. The shared nature of the service means fewer bikes need to be manufactured, and the maintenance is centralized, potentially reducing overall resource use. However, if you're a very frequent rider, a personal bike might be more sustainable in the long run."
  },
  {
    question: "How does CitiBike affect urban mobility and city planning?",
    answer: "CitiBike plays a significant role in urban mobility by providing a flexible, eco-friendly transportation option. It can reduce traffic congestion and demand for parking spaces. Cities often integrate bike-sharing systems like CitiBike into their urban planning, leading to more bike lanes and bike-friendly infrastructure, which benefits all cyclists."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the social aspects of using CitiBike compared to individual exercise options?",
    answer: "CitiBike can foster a sense of community and shared urban experience that's different from individual exercise options. You might encounter other riders, participate in CitiBike events, or explore the city in new ways. This social aspect can make exercise feel more like an adventure and less like a chore."
  },
  {
    question: "How does CitiBike impact personal flexibility compared to owning a bike or going to the gym?",
    answer: "CitiBike offers great flexibility for short trips and spontaneous rides without the responsibility of bike ownership. However, it may be less convenient for long rides or trips outside the service area. Gyms offer consistent availability regardless of weather, but are limited to fixed locations. Owning a bike provides the most freedom but requires storage space and maintenance."
  },
  {
    question: "What unique skills or experiences can you gain from regular CitiBike use?",
    answer: "Regular CitiBike use can improve your urban navigation skills, increase your knowledge of the city's layout, and enhance your abilities as a \"city-slicker\". You might also develop a better sense of traffic patterns and urban safety. These skills can be valuable for both biking and non-biking activities."

  {
    question: "Hoboken and Jersey City are in the same service area. Do you recommend riding up from Manhattan, across the George Washington Bridge, and back down to Jersey City?",
    answer: "Absolutely not."
